DASP project webpage, rev. 2023-01-26 (the initial version)

Please note several points:

1. DASP, digital audio signal processor, is a low-latency software with unique technical capabilities.
  Its main goal (among others) is supplying full on-stage automation of audio-and-video FX processing
  for performing musicians.
2. The program is under continuous development.
3. This page is dedicated to helping enthusiast sound engineers and musicians
  with configuring the program for their needs on their particular hardware.
  This does not mean that the program is public and free to download.
  Currently, you can ask for free personal copy directly from the developer.
  (Write a message to the following e-mail: z7d9 [at] yahoo [dot] com)
4. The program is highly configurable, and customizing it requires considerably long learning
  and consulting. Currently, no FAQ or forum exists, while it may be created later.
  Ask questions directly to the dveloper.
  As a starting point, see DASP built-in help. Run
    dasp help
  List of audio devices that can be used with the program:
    dasp devinfo
  See program hot keys:
    Press ! (Shift+1) in the running program.

Info on the current version (Release 2):

	Key features of DASP, if viewed as DAW:
		+ one-touch recording & playback (DASP itself)
		+ mixing (FXE plugin):
			+ low latency (6..10 ms), can be chained with conventional FX processor
			+ can process multiple instruments even on average CPU (starting from 2 cores = 2 instruments at sampling rate 96 kHz)
			+ can use multiple audiointerfaces in parallel (with any host API, including ASIO)
			+ exclusive FX: electronic vargan, multiband compressor
		+ automation (LPC plugin):
			+ editable text configuration of events, reactions, playlists, and presets
			+ handling MIDI input/output commands
		+ system-related:
			+ crossplatformness - Windows, Linux (incl. small systems like Raspberry Pi), MacOS
			+ portability - new installation by just copying program folder
			+ no GUI, basic program control is console-based
			+ all program configurations are plain editable text files
	Tested applications (historically):
		1) As DAW, in studio recording
		2) As metronome, in rehearsals
		3) As spectrum analyzer, in audio electronics engineering
		4) As fully automated multi-FX processor, in live performances
